    "### Executive Summary\n",
    "***\n",
    "1. Similar to most games, the majority of players of Heroes of Pymoli were observed to be male. Through analysis of the gender statistics of our data the following have been found:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The player base of 576 unique players with optional in-game item purchases consists majority of males (84%), and the minority of 14% females and roughly 2% other or non-disclosed members. \n",
    "    * The age groups range widely from <10 to 40+, however the majority of players (76.7%) fall within the ages 15 to 29, with the 20-24 age group (44.8%) being the largest group within this majority.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Analyses of the purchase data yielded intriguing results, as described by the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Despite Heroes of Pymoli being a free to play game, the total number of in-game item purchases amounted to 780 counts over 183 unique in-game items, grossing a total of \\\\$2379.77 with an average purchase price of \\\\$3.05.\n",
    "    * Interestingly when analyzing the gender and age demographics of these item purchases, males purchased 83.6% (652 items, \\\\$4.07 average purchase per person) and females purchased 14.5% (113 items; \\\\$4.47 average purchase per person) of the total purchases; players within the largest player base, those aged between 15 to 29, purchased a total of \\\\$1819.95 (76.5%). \n",
    "    * Notably, the 35-39, <10, and 20-24 age groups had the highest average total purchase per person (\\\\$4.76, \\\\$4.54, and \\\\$4.32, respectively). However, it is important to state that the overall difference (lowest average: \\\\$3.19 and highest average: \\\\$4.76) between averages isn't substantial enough to suggest game changes catered toward these highest purchasing groups. \n",
    "    * The top 5 spenders spent \\\\$74.96 total with 5 items being the maximum number of items purchased by a single player. 4 of the 5 top spenders are male and all top spenders are 20-25 years of age. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Further investigating the most profitable and popular items through total revenue and purchase count analyses, the most aesthetically pleasing or \"biggest-bang-for-the-buck\" items can be identified. \n",
    "\n",
    "    * The 5 most popular items (highest purchase count) have purchase counts ranging from 8 to 12 (4.4%-6.6% of total purchases). The 5 top grossing items earned \\\\$34.80 to \\\\$50.76 (1.5%-2.1%). These statistics show that the overall balance (in-game ability or perceived power) of the optional purchase items is pretty level and fair. In other words, Heroes of Pymoli does not have items that are dominantly sought after by the player community due to certain items giving unfair advantages (\"overpowered\" AKA \"being OP\") to those who purchase it. It is important for such phenomena to be avoided to prevent the game from being known as a \"pay to win\" game.  \n",
    "    * The number one item, \"Oathbreaker\", had the highest gross and the most purchases, which shows that, despite its medium-to-high price, players may have found such an item valuable and reasonably priced for its abilities. Other honorable mentions include \"Fiery Glass Crusader\" (22th most expensive item) and \"Nirvana\" (6th most expensive item) which have resulted in high remarks in both categories, despite their high prices. Such items may be significantly strong and popular to those who are willing to invest in pricey in-game items.\n",
    "    * Of the items that qualified for the top 5 list for one list but not the other, \"Pursuit\" (high purchase count but low gross) may either be popular due to the affordable price or show that such an item is priced lower than its perceived value. Such items can set an example and be used as a benchmark for future item updates and pricing strategies.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Overall, the gender statistics show a reasonable proportion taking into account the higher male player presence, which is commonplace in the gaming industry. The age statistics describe a healthy spread similar to most other games. In terms of purchase statistics, the findings illustrate that the game and its optional in-game purchases are in a sound environment, both playable and enjoyable to those who wish to make high investments, to those willing to make small purchases, and to those who enjoy playing the content for free.  It is usually frowned upon to change prices of existing items, thus closer observation of pricing of future item introductions is highly suggested to optimize gross or cater to a particular (low to high willingness to purchase) group. For instance, the majority of fantasy games run into the problem of bridging the \"power\" gap between newer and older players (how long one has been playing the game) as older players have had a longer time to enhance and level their characters than those who just started; introducing more affordable, lower tier items for newer players can help them advance at a faster pace while avoiding older players from feeling like their in-game progression is obsolete. \n",
