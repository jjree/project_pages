Citi Bike Ridership Statistics: 
"Who is riding our bikes?"  

Subscribers have shown a promising increase over observed range of 
dates. There were more male riders than female riders and most riders 
are subscribers.

Phenomenon 1: 
"Which locations are popular?" 

Top starting stations overlap quite heavily with top ending stations. 
The least popular starting and ending stations also display overlap. 
Such a phenomenon can be assumed to be affected by the location of the station 
(locations with NYC landmarks or high number of workplaces). Making 
sure enough bikes are available in highly popular stations will be 
crucial to the Citi Bike Program; also observation of whether other 
factors (not location)  are affecting less popular sites is needed 
to boost the usage of these stations.

Phenomenon2: 
"Are all bikes used equally?" 

Some bikes were found to be more "popular" than others, possibly due 
to their starting location (further investigation is needed to prove 
this). Also this dashboard provides vital information of which bikes 
may need repair/maintenance relative to their frequency and duration of usage.

Appendix: 
Observation of Top Routes Taken by Riders. 
I wanted to see whether mapping the most popular routes (start-end stations) 
would provide interesting results because it would provide intriguing information
of where people were traveling from specific starting stations, in particular the 
most popular stations. 

Appendix: 
Overview of Trip Distance and observation of trip distance per age. 

It can be observed that riders around the 20s-40s ride bikes the longest durations. 
The trip distances were quite spread out with an average distance of 2.12 miles.
